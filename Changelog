0.1.4
FEATURE: Add in new patch for disabling level sensor on all Treasure chests
and loot drop
BUGFIX: New games weren't initialising the blank party correctly, this was
causing New Games (as opposed to Reset Games which should have worked) to
fail soon after loading in Wizardry in a variety of ways. [ It is not
necessary to repatch the EXE, as the patch is unchanged, but any previously
created NEW games are corrupt and should be regenerated. ]
BUGFIX: Don't corrupt save game file if Save As is chosen on the currently
loaded file instead of Save, just silently map it through to Save.
BUGFIX: New Game RIFF header had wrong size - caused New Games to fail to
reload in Editor.
BUGFIX: Crashing even attempting to create a New Game.
BUGFIX: Exported characters not getting an automatic CHR suffix.
