QT Based Save Game editor for Wizardry 8

Latest Release 0.1.5

Fixes another crash. No _known_ bugs (but probably a few unknown ones based on track record so far).

Allows for editting characters and parties from SirTech's Wizardry 8 game.
Also allows patching of the original executable to play the alternative import scenarios from Wizardry 7,
restore a more pickpocket friendly behaviour, bypass treasure chest level sensors and randomise the chests
on open instead of at level entry.

Prebuilt Windows binaries provided:

Wizardry8Editor_win32.exe    MD5:d46625834edb7dc2133f4a49115e2146

Wizardry8Editor_win64.exe    MD5:c49c6b0abff470dd3476d70d133ae539

32 Bit version is compiled with older version of Qt and should work with Operating Systems as old as Windows XP
64 Bit version requires Windows 7 or newer but also contains HiDPI support
